      <p>Webslides are made in HTML, CSS and Javascript, the building blocks of the world wide web. Essentially, this means that everything on the web can be seamlessly embedded into your slides, such as YouTube movies, tweets, flipped classroom tools, dynamic graphics, etc. It also allows for easy conversion to PDF or printing in different modi.</p>
      <p>
      Because every slide is a website in itself, it also has its own web address, thus allowing you to link to specific slides from other platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. In its turn, this allows you to make your material more accessible and hold discussions on your studentâ€™s preferred social network.</p>
      <p>
Using web technology has other big benefits as well. Firstly, webslides will always be on the technological forefront, growing and improving just as fast as the web does. Secondly, just as its underlying technology, the webslide project will always be free to use and accessible everywhere, as it should be. Even our source code will be available to any and all who wish to improve upon it. </p>
