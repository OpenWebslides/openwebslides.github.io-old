        At the core of the Open Webslides project is the new format of course slides, invented by Ruben Verborgh. These webslides differ from current slide solutions in a variety of ways.

        Webslides, as the name suggests, are slides made with web technology, namely HTML, CSS and Javascript. Essentially, this means that every slide in itself is a website and as such, is able to do everything a website can. You can seamlessly embed YouTube videos, flipped classroom tools, dynamic graphics, etc. The possibilities are virtually endless.
      </p>
      <p>Because every slide is a website in itself, they also have their own URL, thus allowing you to link to specific slides from other platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. In its turn, this allows you to make your material more accessible and hold discussions on various social networks.

      <p>
        Integrated in webslides is a version control system that tracks changes and contributions over time. This versioning allows you to see at a glance what has been changed to your material and by whom, giving you the option to integrate or refuse the changes made. The result is a platform that promotes co-creation and sharing.</p>
