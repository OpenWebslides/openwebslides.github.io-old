# jekyll-bootstrap-theme

Jekyll theme w/ Bootstrap; see a live demo @ [`henrythemes.github.io/jekyll-bootstrap-theme` Â»](http://henrythemes.github.io/jekyll-bootstrap-theme)


Note: The theme uses the bootstrap sass/scss (source) version
letting you change (override) all bootstrap css variables.

Example:

~~~
tbd
~~~


Note: GitHub Pages has built-in support for sass/scss, thus, your static
site will result in a single all-in-one-file stylesheet, that is, `style.css`.
