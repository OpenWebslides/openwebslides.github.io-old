Web innovation, embedded in your slides
------------

Open webslides are online course slides made in HTML, a markup language used to build websites.
Because webslides are made in the same way as websites, all possibilities of the web can seamlessly be embedded into your slides.
YouTube movies, tweets from Twitter, interactive web pages, dynamic graphics etc... everything can be added to the course material in no time!

Related material on the web can be accessed by simply clicking on the web links added to the content of the slides.
Because every slide is a website in itself and because each slide has its own web address, you can link to a specific slide
from any other web platform (such as Facebook, Twitter...).
Therefore, discussions on the Minerva fora, Facebook and other media can take place in a more focused way, referring to specific slides.

Co-creation
------------

As an added benefit, students can contribute to high quality, comprehensible slides.
How do we go about co-creating course content in a manageable way? Follow along on the diagram below.

By posting the slides on an online collaboration platform, the lecturer invites the students to make suggestions.
These suggestions can be made immediately during the lecture or while studying.
In addition, suggestions can be made on a number of levels either targeting the specific content of the slides,
the way in which the content is presented or the way in which the course material is structured.
Students can for example ask for clarification on ambiguous statements, embed an insightful YouTube video to
illustrate difficult concepts or add a link to a relevant publication.
The lecturer can then accept or reject the proposed adjustments and by simply clicking a button the official course slides will be updated.
An updated version of the course material is thereby available to all students in a matter of seconds.

As our central collaboration platform we will be using the popular [Github](https://www.github.com "Github Homepage")
platform. This is an online community that is already sharing and collaborating on some 10.000 software projects.

What does 'open' mean exactly?
------------

This aspect of the slides is entirely in the hands of the lecturer: they can decide how open their webslides
are when it comes to both adaptability and visibility.

The **adaptability** is easy to vary: the lecturer can choose to remain the sole person allowed to accept or reject changes.
Alternatively, also co-lecturers and teaching assistants can be delegated the right to manage the course material or
these rights can be delegated to the student representatives. Whatever the choice, the decision is up to the lecturer.

The **visibility** is technically equally easy to vary, but extra care needs to be taken in order not to cause any infringements on intellectual property rights.
Briefly summarized, the lecturer can choose between two systems.
On the one hand, the lecturer can opt to place his/her content behind a UGent log-in page.
When placing your content behind such a log-in and when the content is used for educational purposes only,
the law offers a broad protection against intellectual property right infringements.
On the other hand, the lecturer can choose to make his/her content publicly available, also outside the UGent community.
In that case, the content that can legally be made public is more limited.
It will then be important that the lecturer assures that the content contains no infringements or that the consent of the author is obtained accordingly.
When in doubt whether your content is covered or not, our team will be able to provide the necessary legal support.

Are webslides easy to make?
------------

Yes, you don't need to be a seasoned programmer or write HTML scripts to get started.
There are a number of web applications that offer an accessible interface for making webslides.
One of these interfaces that also provides an intuitive demo is for example [Slides](https://slides.com/).

By the way, the first UGent course with open webslides has already started in February 2016: the [course on Web technology](http://rubenverborgh.github.io/WebFundamentals/#).
